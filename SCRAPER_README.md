## Usage

### Basic Usage

#### Single Letter Scraping
```bash
# Scrape artists for letter 'j' with IDs (default, slower)
node genius-scraper.js

# Scrape artists for a specific letter with IDs
node genius-scraper.js a
node genius-scraper.js k
node genius-scraper.js z

# Fast mode: Skip ID extraction for quicker results
node genius-scraper.js j --no-ids
node genius-scraper.js a --no-ids
```

#### Bulk Scraping (All Letters A-Z)
```bash
# Scrape ALL letters with IDs (very slow - several hours!)
node genius-scraper.js all

# Bulk scrape ALL letters without IDs (much faster - ~30 minutes)
node genius-scraper.js all --no-ids
```

## Output Format

The scraper generates JSON files with the following structure:

```json
{
  "letter": "Q",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-11T05:36:00.714Z",
  "totalArtists": 233,
  "popularCount": 20,
  "regularCount": 213,
  "artists": {
    "popular": [
      {
        "name": "Qadir Khan",
        "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Qadir-khan",
        "type": "popular",
        "id": "1272287"
      }
    ],
    "regular": [
      {
        "name": "Q",
        "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Q",
        "type": "regular",
        "id": "2980"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Note**: The `id` field contains the Genius artist ID extracted from the iOS app link on each artist's page. If ID extraction fails for an artist, the `id` field will be `null`.

## Artist Types

- **Popular Artists**: Featured artists with higher prominence on the index page
- **Regular Artists**: Standard alphabetical listing of all other artists

## Firebase Integration (Future)

The scraper includes a `prepareForFirestore()` method that formats data for Firebase Firestore:

```javascript
{
  name: "Artist Name",
  url: "https://genius.com/artists/artist-name",
  id: "673285", // Genius artist ID from iOS app link
  type: "popular" | "regular",
  letter: "j",
  scrapedAt: Date
}
```

## Dependencies

- `axios` - HTTP client for web requests
- `cheerio` - Server-side jQuery implementation for HTML parsing
- `fs` - Node.js file system (built-in)

## Files Generated

### Single Letter Mode
- `genius-artists-{letter}.json` - Main output file with all scraped data

### Bulk Mode (`all`)
- `genius-artists-{date}/` - Timestamped folder containing:
  - `genius-artists-a.json` through `genius-artists-z.json` - Individual letter files
  - `scraping-summary.json` - Complete statistics and metadata

## Artist ID Extraction

The scraper extracts Genius artist IDs from iOS app links found in the `<head>` section of each artist page:

```html
<link href="ios-app://709482991/genius/artists/673285" rel="alternate">
```

From this link, the ID `673285` is extracted and stored with the artist data.

### Performance Considerations

#### Single Letter Mode
- **With ID extraction**: ~500ms delay between requests (respectful rate limiting)
  - Letter 'J' (~750 artists): ~6-7 minutes
  - Letter 'Q' (~233 artists): ~2-3 minutes
- **Without ID extraction** (`--no-ids` flag): Very fast (~30 seconds for any letter)

#### Bulk Mode (All Letters A-Z)
- **With ID extraction**: ~3-6 hours (depending on total artist count ~15k-20k)
- **Without ID extraction** (`--no-ids` flag): ~20-30 minutes

### Success Rate

Typically achieves 95-99% success rate for ID extraction. Some artists may not have iOS app links, resulting in `null` ID values.

## Notes

- Uses appropriate User-Agent headers to avoid blocking
- Respects Genius.com's structure and only scrapes publicly available data
- Implements rate limiting (500ms delays) to be respectful to servers
- Progress tracking with visual progress bars for long operations
- Designed to be easily extensible for additional letters or bulk scraping
- Ready for integration with Firebase Firestore database
