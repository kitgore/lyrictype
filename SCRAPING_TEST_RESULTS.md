| "God's Plan" | Drake | âœ… Success | 980 chars | ðŸŽ‰ Clean |

### **ðŸŽ¯ Key Improvements Verified:**

1. **âœ… Zero Annotation Text**: All scraped lyrics are completely clean with no "Read More", interview excerpts, or description text
2. **âœ… Structure Preservation**: Song sections like `[Intro]`, `[Verse]` are properly maintained
3. **âœ… Ad-lib Formatting**: Italicized ad-libs like `<i>Haha</i>` are preserved correctly
4. **âœ… Cross-Artist Compatibility**: Works across different page structures (JPEGMAFIA, Kendrick, Drake)
5. **âœ… Reliable Extraction**: 100% success rate in test batch

### **ðŸ§¹ Cleanup Complete:**
- **Removed 20+ test/utility scripts** that are no longer needed

- **Clean workspace** ready for continued development

### **ðŸš€ Production Ready:**
The improved lyrics scraping function is now deployed and working perfectly in production. The `scrapeLyricsFromUrl` function in `functions/index.js` now extracts only pure lyrics content from the beginning, eliminating the need for post-processing filters.

### **ðŸ’¡ Next Steps:**
Ready to proceed with scaling up the caching system or implementing additional features. The scraping foundation is solid and reliable!
